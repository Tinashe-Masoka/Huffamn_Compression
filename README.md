# Huffamn_Compression
Huffman Compression is a lossless algorithm that reduces data size by assigning shorter binary codes to frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequent ones. It builds a binary tree based on character frequencies and encodes the data, making it more efficient for storage or transmission.
